				How far would you go to watch a movie with the gang? Answer: At least Kolkata.<br />
					To watch the new Makoto Shinkai movie, Suzume no Tojimari, we went to South City Mall. From toto races, early Sunday morning trains, bus rides full of jokes, and a wonderful cinematic experience, this trip was our last big thing for this semester.
